# ConnectPro

**ConnectPro** is a real-time chat application designed to provide seamless messaging, audio, and video call functionalities. Built using **Socket.IO** for real-time communication, **WebRTC** for video/audio calls, and a tech stack including **Node.js**, **Express**, **React**, and **MongoDB**, this project enables users to connect in a modern, dynamic chat environment.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Chat with friends instantly using Socket.IO.
- **Audio & Video Calls**: Connect with others through high-quality audio and video powered by WebRTC.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed with a mobile-first approach, works seamlessly across all devices.
- **Dynamic Inbox**: See your message history and conversation list with live updates.
- **Call Timer**: Displays call duration during audio/video calls.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **Audio/Video**: WebRTC

## Current Challenge

While **ConnectPro** works perfectly within a local network, there is a limitation with the **TURN server** configuration when trying to support audio and video calls over wider networks. Currently, the project uses a free community TURN server, which is not fully reliable for all network environments. This may cause the video/audio calls to fail or perform poorly across different networks.

### Next Steps

- **Upgrade to a paid or self-hosted TURN server**: To improve connectivity and ensure the app works across various networks, Iâ€™m exploring better TURN server options. This upgrade will enable more robust video and audio calls without the current network limitations.
